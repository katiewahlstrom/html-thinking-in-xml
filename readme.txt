How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
    -I read that XML and HTML are cousins.  I really liked that image, it helped me to understand the connection.  While they have similarities, the function of each is different and unique.   
What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
    -The big benefit I see is the very organized structure, would would make organizing and finding the information you need much more easily, especially if you have multiple people putting in information.  It requires everyone to use the same rules.  
What are some disadvantages? 
    -It seems like the biggest disadvantage is the limitations of XML compared to HTML.  It is long and can feel really tedious.
